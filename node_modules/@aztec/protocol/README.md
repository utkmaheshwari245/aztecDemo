## Protocol

This package contains the core smart contracts of the AZTEC Protocol. The contracts are written in solidity and yul.

**IMPORTANT: The deployed AZTEC smart contracts use a trusted setup created by AZTEC in-house and should only be used for testing and development purposes. We will be launching a multiparty computation protocol to create a trusted setup that is secured by the wider Ethereum community, where only one person has to act honestly for the setup database to be secure. If you wish to participate please let us know at hello@aztecprotocol.com**

## Pre Requisites

### Truffle

```bash
$ yarn global add truffle
$ yarn global add ganache-cli
```

## Usage

To venture out with the contracts, just compile and deploy them with truffle:

```bash
truffle compile --all
truffle migrate --network development
```

Make sure to have a running ganache instance in the background.
